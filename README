SMR4X - Mutated Ambika SMR-4 voice card

SMR4X is a mutation of the original Ambika SMR-4 voice card with an additional mash up of various other design modifications:
- Added programmable 4P/2P filter slope selection (ported from SMR-4-Pi but with added decoupling capacitors for the 4052 and excluding the 1P/3P slopes)
- Added programmable full bandwidth resonance compensation by optional bypass of capacitor in feedback (inspired by Shruthi-1 Sound Designer Edition). NOTE: FOR SOME REASON THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, SEE https://forum.mutable-instruments.net/t/another-modified-ambika-smr-4-voice-card/
- Added 50k trimpot and modified related resistor value (from 150k to 120k) to allow for filter tuning (ported from SMR4-Plus)
